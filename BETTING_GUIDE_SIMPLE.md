## 📱 BETTING TERMINOLOGY EXPLAINED

**Stake:** The amount you bet (e.g., $10)  
**Odds:** The multiplier (2.50 means you get $2.50 for every $1)  
**Returns:** Total money back if you win (stake × odds)  
**Profit:** Money you win (returns - stake)  

**Example:**
- Stake: $10
- Odds: 2.50
- Returns: $10 × 2.50 = $25
- Profit: $25 - $10 = $15

**1X2 Market:**
- 1 = Home team wins
- X = Draw
- 2 = Away team wins

**Accumulator (Acca):** Combining multiple bets (DON'T DO THIS as a beginner - too risky!)

---

## 💡 BEGINNER TIPS

### ✅ DO:
- **Start small** - Use $2-5 per bet first time

- **Track all bets in a spreadsheet**
- **Cash out profits** - Don't reinvest everything
- **Shop for best odds** - Compare bookmakers
- **Bet 2-4 hours before kickoff** - Odds are more stable

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Don't do accumulators** - Single bets are safer
